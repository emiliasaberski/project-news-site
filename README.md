# News Site

I wanted a clean design for my news site and took my inspiration from Wired. Since I love film and TV I decided to have that as my subject and it is also easy to find content to link to. 

## The problem

At first I had a hard time deciding what the site should look like and it's content. But looking at previous projects and browsing sites I got inspiration and could start building. The hardest part with the coding was the use of Flexbox and CSS Grid. By looking at the course-material and the guides to Flexbox and CSS Grid I could solve most of my problems. I never really grasped how to use Javascript and therefor decided not to do it in this project. But looking forward to do it henceforth.
